PNOTIFY
-------

libpnotify is an event notification framework for monitoring files and directories.
It is designed to be portable across different Unix-like kernels and currently
supports Linux and BSD.  The API is very similar to the inotify(7) API under Linux.

libpnotify has been ported to the following platforms:

	* Linux 2.6
	* OpenBSD 4.0
	* NetBSD 3.0
	* MacOS/X 10.4

Even though libpnotify is built as a shared library by default, 
it is easier for application developers to include
pnotify.c and pnotify.h in their source tree and not depend
on the existence of a shared library.
